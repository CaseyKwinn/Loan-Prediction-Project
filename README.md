# Loan-Prediction Project

This was a project I worked on alongside an online course from Analytics Vidya. While I can say I had a pretty solid grasp of the concepts and techniques I applied in the first 5 steps, I'd be lying if I said I understood everything I did through and through. Still, it was great experience!

While there definetly is more to work on here, I feel as though many of those things would require advanced techniques I still don't understand properly. Since my main goal is to get a solid and practical understanding of the basics when working with data, I'll just say that I'm done for now and might return to it later.
